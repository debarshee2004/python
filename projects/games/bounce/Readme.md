# Bounce! - A Simple Python Game

This is a simple Python game called "Bounce!" created using the Tkinter library. In this game, you control a paddle to bounce a ball and prevent it from falling to the bottom of the screen.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included in Python standard library)

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script provided in this repository.

   ```bash
   python bounce.py
   ```

2. Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle left and right, respectively.

3. Bounce the ball with the paddle and prevent it from falling to the bottom of the screen.

4. If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen, you'll see a "Game Over" message.

## Code Explanation

The Python script uses the Tkinter library to create a game window, a paddle, and a ball. Here's a brief explanation of the main components and their functions:

- `tk` is the game window created using Tkinter.

- `canvas` is the game area where the paddle and ball are drawn.

- `Ball` class represents the bouncing ball. It has methods to check for collisions with the paddle and to control the ball's movement.

- `Paddle` class represents the player-controlled paddle. It can move left and right and has methods to handle user input.

- The game loop (`while 1`) keeps the game running, continuously updating the ball's and paddle's positions.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the code:

- Ball and paddle colors by changing the color arguments when creating the `Ball` and `Paddle` objects.

- Initial ball speed by changing the `start` list in the `Ball` class's constructor.

- Paddle's width and initial position.

- You can also implement additional features or levels to make the game more interesting.

## Dependencies

The game relies on the Tkinter library, which is usually included with Python. No additional dependencies are required.
